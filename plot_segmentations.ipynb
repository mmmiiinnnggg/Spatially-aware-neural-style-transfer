    "\n",
    "This example compares four popular low-level image segmentation methods.  As\n",
    "it is difficult to obtain good segmentations, and the definition of \"good\"\n",
    "often depends on the application, these methods are usually used for obtaining\n",
    "an oversegmentation, also known as superpixels. These superpixels then serve as\n",
    "a basis for more sophisticated algorithms such as conditional random fields\n",

    "\n",
    "Quickshift is a relatively recent 2D image segmentation algorithm, based on an\n",
    "approximation of kernelized mean-shift. Therefore it belongs to the family of\n",
    "local mode-seeking algorithms and is applied to the 5D space consisting of\n",

    "One of the benefits of quickshift is that it actually computes a\n",
    "hierarchical segmentation on multiple scales simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quickshift has two main parameters: ``sigma`` controls the scale of the local\n",
    "density approximation, ``max_dist`` selects a level in the hierarchical\n",
    "segmentation that is produced. There is also a trade-off between distance in\n",

    "quickly gained momentum and is now widely used. See [3]_ for details.  The\n",

    "\n",

    "The algorithm views the image as a landscape, with bright pixels forming high\n",
